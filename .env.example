# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to a new file named .env in the root directory.
# 2. Fill in your actual database credentials and JWT secrets in the .env file.
# 3. Ensure the .env file is listed in your .gitignore to prevent committing sensitive information.
#    (If node_modules/ is already in .gitignore, .env is usually covered if it's at the root,
#     but explicitly adding .env to .gitignore is a good practice.)
